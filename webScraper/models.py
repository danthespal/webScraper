'''
SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper
that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,
designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into
a simple and Pythonic domain language.
See: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/

Here, I use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to query and manipulate data
from the database using the object-oriented paradigm. In particular, I use SQLAlchemy.
I wonâ€™t cover the details of ORM and please refer to this article for some Pros and Cons.
